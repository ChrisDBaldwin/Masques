# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Masques, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include a clear description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce

## What to Report

- Security issues in masque parsing or validation
- Potential for privilege escalation through masque definitions
- MCP server configuration vulnerabilities
- Intent boundary bypasses
- Information disclosure through masque loading

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution target**: Depends on severity, typically within 30 days for critical issues

## Scope

This policy applies to the Masques plugin code and bundled masque definitions. Issues in third-party MCP servers referenced by masques should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate them
